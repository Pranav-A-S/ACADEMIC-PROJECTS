            I have been using the device for 3 weeks now. A decent system for programmers and more than great for students.
                    Intel iCore5 10Gen with 8 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD, the system is having an high end configuration which is more than enough for day to day activities - be it general internet surfing, 
                    or for office utility or for programming.                    
                    Being SSD device it is quite fast than HDD machines. Keyboard, Touchpad, Speakers are well built for regular usage.                    
                    Comes with Windows 10 OS and MS Office Home & Student - a bonus for those who are heavily dependent on MS Office.                    
                    It is really good product at a very low price.

                            I am using this laptop for 2 weeks.
                            The basic functionality is good.
                            This major drawback is the cheap plastic used for the body.
                            There are wifi issues. The wifi signal receptions is low.
                            If the wifi is disconnected and reconnects again, the laptop does not detect it again.
                            This is a major flaw.

                                            Light weight!
                                            Registration with Microsoft Account and HP account is far more easy !
                                            No need for the external paid service for Set up when you know the basics!
                                            Has all the necessary ports and you don't need a converter for anyone!
                                            Overall a five Star for the quick delivery, great stuff and easy configuration !

                                             I would like to point out a few things that were not clearly provided in the product description.
                                                   <p> 1. There is no finger print sensor in this model (unlike the picture shown in the product page).</p>
                                                   <p>2. There is no LAN port on this laptop.</p>
                                                    <p>3. There are only 2 USB ports and there is a USB-C port , a HDMI port and a SD card reader.</p>
                                                    <p>4. Available space , out of the 512 GB, is 476 GB .</p>
                                                  <p>  5. Out of the 8GB RAM, 7.6 GB available for use. It comes with 2 X 4GB RAM sticks, and maximum possible upgrade is to 16GB</p>
                                                    <p>7. Keyboard has LED backlight.</p>
                                                   <p> 8. Got a battery backup of about 6+ hours doing basic programming, with Wi-Fi on and Bluetooth off, screen brightness set to 30%</p>
                                                    <p>9. It took about an hour to charge the battery completely.</p>
                                                    <p>10. Microsoft Office - Home and Student 2019, with life long subscription, is pre-installed.</p>
                                                    <p>11. Webcam is 720p with a very average image quality.</p>                                                    
                                                   <p>Screen colors do appear a tad, not very vibrant, but definitely not washed out. One thing that I didn't like is the power button, just a minor thing that you could live with . There are some models from Acer and Lenovo of similar configuration and less pricey , but having used an Acer laptop prior to this I opted for HP.
                                                    So basically this is a very good office laptop, with a great battery life and good ergonomics .</p>
