                  Product was excellent.if you can use the mobile with little care and you can shell the asking price this 
                  was the best mobile you can buy at any price point.but the the shipping was slow even if i had prebooked the product.
                  One of the best Samsung phones so far
                  But you have to very careful using this device..

                          I have been a long time iphone user, but due to the delay in this year's iphone 12 launch and the innovation shown
                           by Samsung with this phone, I made the jump to the Fold 2 this time. I must say that the premium build, large screen and awesome camera has made it truly worth it. 
                           Kudos to Samsung for the competitive pricing as well, was expecting this to be launched at ~1.7-1.8 Lakhs. Wherever I take this phone, this turns heads for sure.
                            The large OLED screen is perfect for watching content and it supports HDR on netflix as well. Overall, an awesome product and am loving it!

                                 Very excited to use the phone and eager how it looks till I get the phone from the time of order.
                                   <p> Pros:</p>
                                    If you are gamer then you will enjoy the big screen and resolution.
                                    Both the Cameras are just awesome ( best in market)
                                    Looks and feels premium when you hold it in your hand
                                    Comes with dual battery which last for 2 days for heavy users
                                    Performance of the phone is expected to be great due to its price and is up to mark till now.
                                    Comes with 25w charger and supports wireless charging.                                    
                                   <p> Cons:</p>
                                    Main problem to buy the phone is its price.. which I feel it's over priced.
                                    Feels bit heavier.
                                    As I like using slim phones.. felt bit uncomfortable in holding the phone.
                                    Nothing much different from other samsung phones.. only the fold is exciting.

                                     Samsung delivers again with their newest flagship in foldable smartphones. The Galaxy Fold 2 has fixed perhaps a lot of the pressing issues with the Fold 1 and made it faster and better.
                                           <p> The hinge is perhaps the most important piece of any foldable tech and Samsung definitely delivers in this regard. Initially I was very worried about opening and 
                                               closing my phone but the transition is pretty smooth and within five minutes of holding this device you will get used it it. (Tip: Don't press the screen when folding 
                                               but using the bottom-middle area of the hinge and fold your phone it will protect the screen longer)</p>                                            
                                            <p>Whilst many people have concerns with the durability of the phone, I have already dropped it twice (both when it was closed thankfully) and so far it has survived but 
                                                I don't recommend you doing it.</p>                                            
                                            <p>Performance is excellent with 12 gigs of ram, latest processor from snapdragon and am excellent GPU. Games and applications run smoothly without any lag. 
                                                Sound is excellent with dual speakers! Multiple apps can also run simultaneously without issues. Recommend getting the goodlock app to unlock several features of the phone and customize them further.</p>                                            
                                            <p>Price is sadly very very steep though I couldn't resist and bought it anyway but I feel like it should have atleast provided the galaxy buds live or pro along with the phone. But at least you do get the wired AKG earbuds which are excellent. 
                                                No case is provided which is another downer. Samsung if you are selling a phone at a premium price you should atleast provide a premium accessory!</p>
                                            
                                            Overall I'm definitely loving this phone.

                                                    Samsung should provide buds and wireless charger, case for free.
