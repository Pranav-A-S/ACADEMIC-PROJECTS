                    The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.
                    Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.
                   <p> The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.</p>

                           Nicely packed !! Kudos to seller !!
                            I was very much confused between iphone 11 and this one as the price of iphone dropped ... But i am glad i chose this over iphone 11.
                            <p>1.Display:
                            Main upgrade in iphone 12 is the oled display. Boy o boy the screen is amazing. I have user many android flagship's but this beats them all.</p>
                            <p> 2.Battery:
                            Battery is amazing. I am getting 1.5 days of battery life with my usage.</p>
                            PS: i dont play games.
                           <p>3.IOS:
                            This is my 1st iphone and the experience with ios is great ... Very smooth animations ..even though its not 90hz screen but everything is buttery smooth.</p>
                            <p>4. Camera:
                            The pics from this phone is superb. FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA! You will not be dissapointed.</p>
                           <p> 5 Build &Design :
                            This phone looks and feels very premium compared to other phones.Very comfotable to use.</p>
                            <p>6.Face Id:
                            Face id works very fast and accurate in low lighting conditions.</p>
                            <p>Ios14 is good and we can expect another 4yrs of software updates thats huge 
                            Cons:
                            <p>1.Priced very high but it may be because of high taxes and custom duty.</p>
                            <p>2.No charger and earpods in the box.</p>
                            <p>3.Notifications are a mess ...android is better in managing new notifications.</p>

                                   I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-
                                    Memory,

                                         <p> You can use 100% battery only for 5-6 hours of continuous use after that you have to charge it. Apple should look into this.</p>

                                                    Update after 1 month approx.
                                                    After using it for a month I am in love with this phone. Too smooth and I forgot what is lagging...                                                    
                                                    Battery backup is very good and lasts one and half day easily with normal usage. I charge my phone when the battery is around 30%. Battery health is 100% after a month.                                                    
                                                    Camera is awesome and gives very nicely detailed pictures with true colors.                                                    
                                                    Phone speakers are really great and warm. They are loud but don't shout. Listening music or watching videos are enjoyable without earphones too.                                                    
                                                    4G speed better than other 4g phones I have.
