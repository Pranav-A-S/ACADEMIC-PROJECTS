                           I have this product for over a month now.
                          <P></P> To be honest it's very good at some points of references like :-
                          <p> 1) Smooth & Lagfree OS</p>
                          <p></p> 2) Battery Life
                          <p></p>3) Aesthetics
                          <P></P>But, not so developed in some other feilds like:-
                          <P></P> 1) Accessibility
                          <P></P>2) Storage Status of Device
                          <P></P>3) Cost Effectiveness with accessories or add-ons
                          <P></P>But, to be very honest I'm happy with the device just a small recommendations for anyone buying.
                            Go For The Higher Storage Spec model, it will be helpful to You.

                                    <p> 4. Touchpad experience is like you never need a External Mouse.</p>

                                                cover options as the magnetic cover cause malfunctioning of stylos. Finger print sensor is also of very bad quality.Rest the product is excellent technologically.
