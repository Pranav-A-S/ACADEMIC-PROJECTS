                   I would start by saying that I am extremely delighted with the new Mac. The new magic keyboard is better than the one on the air.
                   The body is beautiful and the look and design are elite. The space grey looks stunning and the size of the laptop is nice and convenient for typing and using it any place as per your comfort. 
                   The speed is really good for an 8GB RAM Mac and I have been trying out some light to moderate photo and video editing, it has been flawless with no rendering issues. 
                   I highly recommend keeping an HDD available to store files that you do not require always on your Mac and keep the essential files only for optimum performance. The display on this Mac is amazing,
                   the pictures clicked on my iPhone look beautiful. The web browsing experience has been really good. Moderate level games run fine like Asphalt 8 or 9 even at top quality graphics. Overall, 
                    the experience has been fantastic and I am glad I upgraded to the Mac pro so soon and didn't wait for Apple Silicon.

                  This Mac is ideal for any student, average coder, professional work, or any relevant field where you need a powerful device and a compact, easy to carry machine. 
                          This doesn't have a dedicated GPU but I don't feel the need for it. The device in itself with all the features is a monster and can smoothly carry out all your daily operations. You can blindly go for this one and 
                          I am sure you won't be disappointed at all. In accessories, I would suggest either a USB C dock or 2 converters to USB 3.0, a keyboard protector, and a good laptop sleeve or bag. This would easily last 4 years as per my understanding.
                         Apple does a great job in terms of longevity, performance, optimization, and simplicity. If you have other Apple products, this would add value to your ecosystem too.

                                         Apple really went all out with this M1 Macbook Pro.
                                              <p>  Its way more powerful than i5 for sure. Go for it and those worried about 8GB Ram. I have been using it for a week for Mobile App development and 
                                                  it runs very smoothly even with simulators and XCode. No issues at all.</p>                                                
                                               <p>The only issue I can think of is that Apple didn't provide a chip with more Graphic power compared to the Macbook Air. 
                                                   Not that the GPU is bad by itself but very few people would really need this Pro model over the Air. It does have the touch bar and 
                                                   much better Sound and a fan for prolonged heavy usage.
                                            Also the apps are ready for M1 so don't worry about incompatibility either. Most apps work Native or some unupdated ones with Rosetta 2.</p>
