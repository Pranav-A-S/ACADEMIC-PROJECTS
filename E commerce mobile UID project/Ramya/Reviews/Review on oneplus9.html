                One day delivery. Very fast. Kuddos on that.
                The phone is amazing. No complains so far. 3 days of heavy usage to check battery camera music everything.        
                Would definitely say one of the best cameras. Sound could have been louder but not at all bad. Battery is excellent.
                 Interface touch smoothness WOW.

                       The product just overheating.. it is unbelievable from such great company production devices.

                    I have been one plus 6t device since 2.5 so far single problem face.. 
                    I just upgraded to one plus 9 but it seems to be the worst decision. I did it as I am feeling now.
