                   Initially I was planning to buy the Oneplus 8 base version but then changed my mind to buy the Pro version.
                   <p> I have received it yesterday and till now it has been a delight using it.</p>
                   <p> The fluid oxygen OS, QHD display, the refresh rate, the camera everything is just mesmerizing.</p>

                                   <p>2. Extremely Fast, no lag at all (snappy) </p>
                                   <p>3. Mind-blowing speakers.. trust me, can feel surround effect.</p>
                                   <p>4. Camera is really good with details. (Depends on the available light and a lot on photography skills)</p>

                                    <p> 2. The display is brilliant though there are some issues with low light video playback. (sometimes annoying)</p>
                                    <p>3. Heating issue ( while gaming, rarely)</p>
                                   <p>4. Everything's not great about the fingerprint scanner.</p>

                                                  This phone has its pros and cons.
                                                  <p>PROS</p>
                                                   <p>1. Super responsive device (no lags at all) </p>
                                                   <p> 2. Typical impressive Oxygen Os (i can nitpick few things though)</p>
                                                   <p>3. Good all round camera(front one could have ben better)</p>
                                                   <p>4. Superb gaming experience, this device is a beast for gaming.</p>
                                                   <p>5. Has USB-PD support too, didn't know till I used a pd charger in this device.</p>
                                                   <p> CONS</p>
                                                   <p>1. Black crush issue is there when set to 120Hz refresh rate, maybe can get fixed through an OTA and its not a deal breaker for me</p>
                                                   <p>2. Horizontal black bar is present from front camera area when set to 120Hz, don't know if it can be fixed with an OTA update or not, again not a deal breaker for me</p>
                                                    <p>Overall i am happy with my purchase. All I wanted a super fast and responsive device. I can ignore the display issues becz it appears in certain circumstances only, rest of the phone experience is amazing.</p>
