            This is worth buying due to its build quality and features, the only problem with heating not too much. Got it for 64k with 1 HDD + 512 SSD and a wireless mouse with it, Buy it in-store.It's really value for money.
                   <p> After 1 month usage:</p>
                    I felt there are some pros and cons so, I am editing this review !!
                    there are a lot of pros I won't talk about it among all the pros I really liked the mat screen - it is excellent                    
                    1st issue with the battery not very good and it's getting almost 4hrs with moderate usage(considering 10th gen laptops)
                    2nd the ventilation(airflow) is very disgusting only one outlet with a single fan -heavy noise with moderate usage it gets heated up like anything.
                    3rd don't think of playing games even if its 4gb graphics card and i7 variant because of the heating issue                    
                    If you don't think this is an issue for you then buy it. use it in the AC room.

                         Laptop performance is poor, hanging and heating a lot. Memory usage automatically increases and forced restart required. Even laptop serial number is not matching with the serial number written in invoice. 
                          Even after repeated request for 4 months, still they failed to give correct serial number.

                                   <p>Top notch configuration for student/ basic gaming and basic mutimedia purpose
                                    Sleek and nice design; Quite light for a 15.6 laptop
                                    Backlit keyboard and no complains about neither keyboard nor touchpad sensitivity
                                    Commendable display, and anti glare</p><br>                                   
                                    Cons:
                                    <p>Heating is a concern but the fan does not make much noise, nor the system shuts due to overheat
                                    Battery life is only 4 hours running MS Word at 50% brightness (system update, scan not running)
                                    Screen frame width is pretty broad especially on the bottom (1.5 inches approx)</p><br>                                    
                                   Overall:
                                    <p>Expensive against the configuration provided compared to other brands. But if you're a DELL fan, and looking for a latest 15.6 laptop, then this is a good call in terms of design and performance
                                    You can turn off the dynamic adaptive brightness (CABC feature) in BIOS settings</p>

                                    This is a good laptop, amazing specs, the nvme ssd and the processors makes it a very fast processor but the cooling needs to be improved as the laptop
                                           gets hot after 15 minutes of usage, however it only gets hot in the battery region the rest of the laptop is cold and if kept on lap you won't feel the heat. Also the display of the laptop is good but 
                                           for a laptop of this price dell should give a better display with more enhanced colors and more sharpness. Although the dell cinema color app makes it a bit better but still the screen and display doesn't 
                                           seems like a full hd screen. Other than that there is no other issue with this laptop, this is a great laptop and if you are a programmer or deal with some moderately intensive tasks then you can go for this one
