                  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome.
                  <p>You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.</p>
                  <p> The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.</p>

                                  The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. 
                                  <p> the Sim tray is made out of metal.
                                    Speakers sound better than my previous phone.</p>
                                    <p> couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!</p>
                                    <p>OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years.</p>
                                    <p> Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.</p>
                                    Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good.
