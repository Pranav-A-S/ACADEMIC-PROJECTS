                  One of the best flagships I have used in my recent purchase... Samsung has done a good job with this S21 series... 
                  The display is super amazing, battery life is fabulous... Overall the product offers a quality experience... Although it should include a charging adapter and a back cover...

                         The fone is a beast.. battery life is superb.. it gets u through the day. 
                          Camera quality is top notch. Finger print scan is the highlight.. my first galaxy fone and I am loving it. A charger brick would have been appreciated but nonetheless every house has a type c charger now a days. So over all a good buy.

                                    The build quality of the phone is good and it also feels sturdy to hold. The matt finish glass back and the chrome finish aluminium body allows for a firm hold [no drops yet ;)]. 
                                    The matt finish metal camera housing blends well with the aluminium body, although the bump seems to be a bit odd but i dont think that would matter, coz most of the users will be using it with a case
                                     [considering the cost of the phone :D].. The overall quality and feel is premium to say the least.
                                    <p>The display quality is good and the 120mhz refresh rate does make the viewing experience stand apart. The touchscreen quality is awesome. Although i would have preferred a curved display.</p>                                    
                                    <p>The sound quality is fairly good,probably coz the ear piece acts as a speaker on top. Could have done better on the sound quality.</p>                                    
                                   <p> The camera quality is superb, although the quality degrades a higher zoom. The night mode enhances the image at the cost of resolution and seems grainy when zoomed in. But it still fairs better.</p>                                    
                                    <p>Phone performance is good with memory hogging apps and games although there is some heating but thats acceptable.</p>                                    
                                    <p>Charging seems to be somewhat slow even with the 25w Samsung charger which needs to be brought separately :( not a good move by Samsung [stop following the crowd ;) ]</p>                                    
                                    Overall to summarize, satisfied with the product. Got what was advertised.

                                       Good and Nice phone...Moved out from Chinese phones ...back to my Galaxy again...Real and true flagship...
                                       Battery life is OK to Good..since it's a single 4800 MAH and it's available for one day..Phone looks decent..Exynos 2100 processor is good and fast enough but
                                       it's still not equal to Snapdragon 888 in some areas...I have not come across any heating issue in this phone..Samsung will release optimized software updates in the near future.
                                        <p>CAMERA quality is really superb and once again Samsung proved they are the leaders...

                                                Samsung flagship doesn’t need any introduction but here is what i have liked and disliked in my usage since last couple of months.
                                               <p> 1. Exceptional screen - super smooth fluid screen. Colours are rich. Switch between 60 and 120 hz option is available.</p>                                                
                                               <p> 2. Pro camera - I am really impressed. I still prefer Google Pixel for camera in a phone and I believe no camera phone in the market can beat that. But the “Pro” mode on this phone is too good. Gives DSLR like features. It is super awesome. Normal camera is also very very good. I am attaching some of the photos taken from this.</p>                                                
                                               <p>3. Average battery life - it is ok. Gives one day backup with average use (4-5) hrs screen time.</p>                                                
                                               <p> 4. Fingerprint sensor doesn’t work with tampered glass - None of the tampered glass avai>>.</p>lable in the market works with in screen-fingerprint sensor. It is better not to use fingerprint sensor if you decide to apply a tampered glass. I am using it without any screen protector. But i am using a flip cover.</p>
